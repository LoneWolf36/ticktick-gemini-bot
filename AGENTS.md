# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `server.js` boots Express, the Telegram bot, the scheduler, and TickTick/Gemini clients.
- `bot/` contains Telegram-facing behavior: `commands.js`, `callbacks.js`, and formatting helpers in `utils.js`.
- `services/` contains core logic and integrations. Keep task execution in `ticktick-adapter.js`, normalization in `normalizer.js`, and orchestration in `pipeline.js`.
- `tests/` holds regression and end-to-end scripts. `kitty-specs/001-task-operations-pipeline/` stores the active spec, plan, and work-package notes.
- Deployment files live at the root: `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml`. Local context starts from `services/user_context.example.js`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies from `package-lock.json`.
- `npm start` runs the production entrypoint with `node server.js`.
- `npm run dev` starts watch mode for local iteration.
- `node tests/run-regression-tests.mjs` runs the lightweight regression suite used in this repo today.
- `node --test tests/regression.test.js` runs the Node test file when your environment allows spawned subprocesses.
- `docker build -t ticktick-gemini .` builds the same container shape used for Render.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use ESM only: `import`/`export`, not CommonJS.
- Follow the existing style: 4-space indentation, semicolons, camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Keep files single-purpose: Telegram interaction in `bot/`, integrations and orchestration in `services/`.
- Prefer named exports for helpers and service factories.
- New task-writing flows must stay on the existing path: `AX intent -> normalizer -> ticktick-adapter`. Do not call the low-level TickTick client directly from bot handlers.

## Testing Guidelines
- Add or update regression coverage for behavior changes in `tests/regression.test.js` or `tests/run-regression-tests.mjs`.
- Name tests by behavior, for example: `executeActions accepts suggested_schedule update alias`.
- Mock TickTick and Gemini integrations in automated tests; keep live API calls in opt-in scripts only.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Match the existing Conventional Commit pattern from history: `feat: ...`, `chore: ...`, `feat(scope): ...`.
- Keep each commit focused to one behavior change or one work package.
- PRs should include a short behavior summary, any new env vars, linked issue or `kitty-specs/...` reference, and sample Telegram output or screenshots when message formatting changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit `.env`, `services/user_context.js`, OAuth tokens, Telegram chat IDs, or Redis credentials.
- Start local setup from `.env.example` and `services/user_context.example.js`.
- When adding a required environment variable, update both `README.md` and `render.yaml`.

## Spec Kitty v3.1.1 Notes (Latest - Upgraded 2026-04-09)
- **CLI Version**: Upgraded from v3.0.1 to v3.1.1 (2026-04-09)
- **Work Package Frontmatter**: WP files in `kitty-specs/**/tasks/WP*.md` use minimal frontmatter. Deprecated fields removed in v3.0.0 migration:
  - Removed: `lane`, `agent`, `shell_pid`, `review_status`, `reviewed_by`, `history`, `assignee`, `progress`, `review_feedback_file`
  - Kept: `work_package_id`, `title`, `dependencies`, `subtasks`, `base_branch`, `base_commit`, `created_at`, `phase`, `requirement_refs`
- **State Tracking**: WP state is tracked exclusively via `status.events.jsonl` files in each feature directory
- **Command Templates**: Planning commands in `.agent/workflows/spec-kitty-*.toml` reference v3.1.0+
- **Platform**: Development platform is Linux
- **Mission Detection**: Commands now use `--mission <slug>` flag (deprecated `--feature` flag)
- **Charter vs Constitution**: `spec-kitty charter` replaces `spec-kitty constitution` across all surfaces
- **Migration History**: 
  - v3.0.1 → v3.1.1 upgrade completed 2026-04-09
  - v2.1.3 → v3.0.1 upgrade completed 2026-03-31
  - Previous migration (v1.0.3 → v2.0.9 → v2.1.3) completed 2026-03-19
  - Frontmatter migration events logged in `kitty-specs/**/status.events.jsonl`

### Key Changes in v3.1.0+
- **Charter Rename**: `spec-kitty constitution` is replaced by `spec-kitty charter`
- **Canonical Flag**: `--mission` is now the official flag for identifying features/missions. `--feature` is deprecated and hidden
- **WP Manifest Format**: `wps.yaml` is now the primary dependency source for task finalization
- **Read-Only Status Commands**: Read-only status commands no longer dirty the Git working tree
- **Explicit Merge Strategy**: Introduces `--strategy` flag (`MERGE`/`SQUASH`/`REBASE`) and `config.yaml` support
- **Clean Git State**: Read-only commands (`status`, `next` query mode, `dashboard`) no longer dirty the working tree
- **Execution Resilience**: Adds `merge --resume`, `implement --recover`, and `doctor` for stale-claim diagnostics
- **Planning-Artifact Execution**: Now runs in the repository root outside the lane graph (instead of lane worktrees)
- **Review Resilience**: Introduces versioned review-cycle artifacts, focused fix prompts, and dirty-state classification

### Key Changes in v3.0.0+
- **Deterministic Branch Contract**: Commands use `target_branch`/`base_branch` from `create-feature --json` output
- **No Auto-Detection**: Mission slug must be provided explicitly via `--mission` flag
- **Direct Repo Execution**: Planning commands (`/spec-kitty.specify`, `/spec-kitty.plan`) work in planning repository (no worktrees)
- **Worktrees for Implementation Only**: Worktrees created during `/spec-kitty.implement WP##` for isolated implementation work
- **Event-Sourced State**: All WP state transitions recorded in `status.events.jsonl` with `event_id`, `actor`, `reason`, and `evidence`
